# New Relic Prometheus OpenMetrics integration

> üöß Important Notice
> 
> Prometheus Open Metrics integration for Kubernetes has been discontinued and will only be supported until the end of June 2023.
>
> See how to install the [Prometheus agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-prometheus-agent/install-prometheus-agent/) to understand its benefits and get a full visibility of your Prometheus workloads running in a Kubernetes cluster.
>
> In case you need to migrate from the Prometheus Open Metrics integration to Open Metrics check the following [migration guide](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-prometheus-agent/migration-guide/).

Fetch metrics in the Prometheus metrics format, inside or outside Kubernetes, and send them to the New Relic platform.

## Installation and usage

For documentation about how to use the integration, refer to [our documentation website](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-prometheus-openmetrics-integration-kubernetes).

Find out more about Prometheus and New Relic in [this blog post](https://blog.newrelic.com/product-news/how-to-monitor-prometheus-metrics/).

## Helm chart

You can install this chart using [`nri-bundle`](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/nri-bundle) located in the
[helm-charts repository](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts) or directly from this repository by adding this Helm repository:

```shell
helm repo add nri-prometheus https://newrelic.github.io/nri-prometheus
helm upgrade --install nri-prometheus/nri-prometheus -f your-custom-values.yaml
```

For further information of the configuration needed for the chart just read the [chart's README](/charts/nri-prometheus/README.md).

## Building

Golang is required to build the integration. We recommend Golang 1.11 or higher.

This integration requires having a Kubernetes cluster available to deploy and run it. For development, we recommend using [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/), [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/), and [skaffold](https://skaffold.dev/docs/getting-started/#installing-skaffold).

After cloning this repository, go to the directory of the Prometheus integration and build it:

```bash
make
```

The command above executes the tests for the Prometheus integration and builds an executable file called `nri-prometheus` under the `bin` directory.

To start the integration, run `nri-prometheus`:

```bash
./bin/nri-prometheus
```

If you want to know more about usage of `./bin/nri-prometheus`, pass the `-help` parameter:

```bash
./bin/nri-prometheus -help
```

External dependencies are managed through the [govendor tool](https://github.com/kardianos/govendor). Locking all external dependencies to a specific version (if possible) into the vendor directory is required.

### Build the Docker image

In case you wish to push your own version of the image to a Docker registry, you can build it with:

```bash
IMAGE_NAME=<YOUR_IMAGE_NAME> make docker-build
```

And push it later with `docker push`

### Executing the integration in a development cluster

- You need to configure how to deploy the integration in the cluster. Copy deploy/local.yaml.example to deploy/local.yaml and edit the placeholders.
- To get the New Relic license key, visit:
   `https://newrelic.com/accounts/<YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID>`. It's located in the right sidebar.
- After updating the yaml file, you need to compile the integration: `GOOS=linux make compile-only`.
- Once you have it compiled, you need to deploy it in your Kubernetes cluster: `skaffold run`

### Running the Kubernetes Target Retriever locally

It can be useful to run the Kubernetes Target Retriever locally against a remote/local cluster to debug the endpoints that are discovered. The binary located in `/cmd/k8s-target-retriever` is made for this.

To run the program, run the following command in your terminal:

```shell script
# ensure your kubectl is configured correcly & against the correct cluster
kubectl config get-contexts
# run the program
go run cmd/k8s-target-retriever/main.go
```

## Testing

To run the tests execute:

```bash
make test
```

At the moment, tests are totally isolated and you don't need a cluster to run them.

## Support

Should you need assistance with New Relic products, you are in good hands with several support diagnostic tools and support channels.

> New Relic offers NRDiag, [a client-side diagnostic utility](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/using-new-relic/cross-product-functions/troubleshooting/new-relic-diagnostics) that automatically detects common problems with New Relic agents. If NRDiag detects a problem, it suggests troubleshooting steps. NRDiag can also automatically attach troubleshooting data to a New Relic Support ticket.

If the issue has been confirmed as a bug or is a Feature request, please file a Github issue.
